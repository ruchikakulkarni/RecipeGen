# Recipe Generator

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- **Project Name** : GenRecipe is a web application that creates recipes that match user's ingredients, preferences and cravings.
- **Features** : Ingredient-Based Recipe Generation - Enter available ingredients, and the application generates recipes that utilize those ingredients.
- User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-navigate interface for a seamless user experience.
